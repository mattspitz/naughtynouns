NaughtyNouns (http://twitter.com/naughtynouns) is a little bot that'll
cause mischief on Twitter.  If you @mention the bot's name with a MadLib,
it'll fill in the madlib with some dirty things.  The words will be
replaced by the appropriate type (noun/adj/adv) concatenated with a dirty
word.  See the twitter feed for examples.

If no one tweets at it for a day, it'll just tweet a random phrase or word.

Happy cursing!
